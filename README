Homework 3 - Team 23
Nicolas Mesa, Di Ruan, Sankalp Singayapally

Test programs:
Please run make in the test folder.
Test program as per homework specification is in def_test
Alternate test program is in main_test
Run the test program and if the parent process sleeps, then children exit with the appropriate error message
Else when event occurs, the child programs exit accordingly

NOISE can be configured in acceleration.h in /linux/include/acceleration.h
System Calls are in /kernel/acceleration.c

We have a daemon process that fetches the sensor data and writes to the kernel.
Kernel then calculates the difference in acceleration between successive daemon data
and stores in a linked list of size WINDOW. To check whether an event has occurred,
for each event, we iterate through the list, while under appropriate locks,
and check if the specified event's baseline deltas are satisfied for the required frequency.
If that condition is satisfied, then we wake up all processes waiting on the event. 

When an event is destroyed, all the processes waiting on it are woken up but know that
it was a spurious wake up based on the returned code. Other binaries in the test folder
were made for easy testing on the emulator. For example, signaler sends accelerations into the kernel.
This was done just to do away with using sensorsim, which also works.
